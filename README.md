# Is It Real

Is it real? The future of video security. Protect yourself from deepfake scams.

The project "Is it real" is a camera library for video call apps that can detect if the video is coming from the camera or not. This is done by using a variety of techniques, such as:

* **Motion detection:** This technique looks for sudden changes in motion, which are more likely to occur in a deepfake video than in a real video.
* **Face detection:** This technique looks for specific facial features that are difficult to replicate in a deepfake video, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth.
* **Image quality analysis:** This technique looks for signs of image manipulation, such as blurriness, artifacts, and inconsistencies in lighting.
* **Detect real camera:** Detect if the video is coming from real cameras (hard for scammers), or from video feeds (easier for scammers to fake).

By combining these techniques, the "Is it real" camera library can provide a high level of accuracy in detecting deepfake videos. This can help to protect users from being scammed by criminals who use deepfake technology to create fake humans for scamming other people.

In addition to detecting deepfake videos, the "Is it real" camera library can also be used to improve the security of video calls. For example, it can be used to verify the identity of the person you are talking to, or to prevent unauthorized access to your camera.

The "Is it real" camera library is an idea for now, but it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the fight against deepfake scams. By making it easier to detect deepfake videos, the "Is it real" camera library can help to protect users and make the internet a safer place.
